Attack Tortoise
==============
A horrible game I wrote years ago

Requirements
------------

* python2
* pygame
* A sense of humor

How to play
----------

    cd src/
    python2 main.py

Left/right moves, up jumps, down goes into defense mode (can't get hurt in defense mode, but it takes a second to come out of it).
Space bar fires motherfucking lasers. You can kill enemies by shooting them or by landing on them in defense mode.
